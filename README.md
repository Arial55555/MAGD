# Welcome to my projects!
## Here are some MAGD assignments I've made in the past semester:
[Lab 5: Intersections](https://github.com/Arial55555/MAGD/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab05_klubertanz):
I made a basic TV set, which has 3 channels and a slippery sliding volume bar.

[Lab 6: Organization](https://github.com/Arial55555/MAGD/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab06_klubertanz):
This is my attempt to make an atari controler- it looks cool, I think!

[Lab 7: Objects](https://github.com/Arial55555/MAGD/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab07_klubertanz):
Leaves on a screen. Click, and it changes which leaves you're controling.

[Lab 8: Type and Image](https://github.com/Arial55555/MAGD/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab08_klubertanz):
**[Sharky and Palp! The Team Bros of the Sea! Sharky and Palp! We dance in victory!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4J_LYl_tQU&t=327s)**

[Lab 10: 3D and Data](https://github.com/Arial55555/MAGD/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_klubertanz):
The lab had to be 3D, and it had to have a CSV file- and the only CSV I had was a Yu-Gi-Oh database.
